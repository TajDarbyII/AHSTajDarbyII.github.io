<p>The game features player-keyed touchdown camera views, additional player solid figures, body types, and improved stadium details. This game is also rated E(For Everyone) and even children can play these types of games. There are options for players just getting into the game and those options are Rookie, Pro, All-Pro, or All- Madden based on the players’ skills.
Free form precision passing can be performed by holding L2/LT and moving the Left Stick. All players would find my website helpful because I have 13 years of experience playing Madden and I know most of the mechanics in the recent Maddens. You can go on practice mode and have someone teach you how to best play the game before you start playing competitively. For High Ball throws, you have to hold RT and then press the icons of whoever is open and for low ball throws, you have to hold LT and press the icon to which player you think is open. If your players are not open, you can flick the right stick upwards with your thumb and have your guy open for at least a couple seconds. Watch some pro Madden players on tutorials of which plays to use based on the coverage that is being used against you and take advantage of any short windows before throwing the ball to your wide receivers/tight ends. It should be easy because I first started playing Madden at the age of 5 and it wasn’t that hard to figure out how I play the game, whether it’s the CPU or an actual player online. </p>
