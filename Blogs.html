<p>(B1)The game features player-keyed touchdown camera views, additional player solid figures, body types, and improved stadium details. This game is also rated E(For Everyone) and even children can play these types of games. There are options for players just getting into the game and those options are Rookie, Pro, All-Pro, or All- Madden based on the players' skills. Free form precision passing can be performed by holding L2/LT and moving the Left Stick. 

<p>All players would find my website helpful because I have 13 years of experience playing Madden and I know most of the mechanics in the recent Maddens. You can go on practice mode and have someone teach you how to best play the game before you start playing competitively. For High Ball throws, you have to hold RT and then press the icons of whoever is open and for low ball throws, you have to hold LT and press the icon to which player you think is open. If your players are not open, you can flick the right stick upwards with your thumb and have your guy open for at least a couple seconds. Watch some pro Madden players on tutorials of which plays to use based on the coverage that is being used against you and take advantage of any short windows before throwing the ball to your wide receivers/tight ends.It should be easy because I first started playing Madden at the age of 5 and it wasn't that hard to figure out how I play the game, whether it's the CPU or an actual player online.<p> 

<p>(B2)What makes video games so enticing is their style, designs, mechanics, and overall how they work and can be played on any compatible gaming device. I have played Madden 23, Injustice 2, Mortal Kombat X/11, and Fortnite during the summer.</p>

<p>(B3)This article explains why people enjoy games. Games can serve as a stress reliever, provide knowledge about how the game works, and distract from negative experiences. Additionally, playing games with friends or alone can help alleviate negative emotions. However, the main issue with gameplay is that it lacks addictiveness. While Madden can be enjoyable and provide some memorable moments, it falls short of being considered elite.</p>

<p>(B4)I agree with the reviewer's criticism of Madden's gameplay. The repetitive animations make it boring and not addictive. I prefer games with better gameplay that never get old. The trailer and how the game is presented also influence my interest. I understand why Brian criticized Madden's gameplay.<p> 

<p>(B5)Toxicity in gaming is like bullying, causing players to lose interest and motivation due to the negative comments and insults from toxic individuals. It is important to address this issue as it affects everyone's gaming experience and can have lasting negative effects. To combat toxicity, players can report, mute, or block toxic individuals to avoid engaging in unnecessary conflicts.</p>

<p>(B6)TSM is known for being one of the most entertaining and competitive teams in Fortnite. They excel in communication and teamwork, ensuring they stay together while rotating and searching for enemies. However, they sometimes underestimate their opponents, but their confidence in their skills should still enable them to win competitive matches.<p>

<p>(B7) This article basically summarized that the Jevons’ Paradox AI can help with everyday life trying to drive safely every single day. It was also said that AI can use tons of electricity compared to whole entire countries. When people use this technology, the tools used will be as accessible and as efficient to their liking. Overall, the impact it would have on the environment would be good as long as this technology is being used in a responsible manner. 
  I think it’s good to use this technology because it wouldn’t become much of a crutch and it can literally be used daily. There is no doubt that people will hear about this technology and marvel at its ways it can be very versatile. There are downsides to this technology, but the benefits of using it outweighs the disadvantages of using this AI Technology.
